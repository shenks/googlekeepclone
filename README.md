### `Outline of Steps Taken to build:`

- front end and styling
- state management for input area
- test it with react dev tool to observe state change
- need an array to store new notes, needs state in App.jsx
- need a function in App.jsx to update state of array
- when we add new note in InputArea, needs to call the function from App.jsx so need props
- need to map the array to display items
- need to provide props to note.jsx to dynamically display array objects
- delete functionality for note component (function in App.jsx passed into Note.jsx)
